## Contributing Guidelines and Folder Naming Conventions

If you want to add a new demo or whitepaper, follow the folder structure convention below,

```
demos/
├─ your-new-demo-folder/
│  ├─ files/
│  │  ├─ image1.PNG
│  │  ├─ image2.PNG
│  │  ├─ sampleSolution.zip
│  ├─ README.md
whitepapers/
├─ your-new-whitepaper-folder/
│  ├─ files/
│  │  ├─ image1.PNG
│  ├─ README.md
├─ your-new-whitepaper2-folder/
│  ├─ summary.pdf
README.md
```

You can decided if you would rather have a ```README.md``` file with Markdown syntax, or if you prefer, you can convert a document into a PDF file and then upload that into the subfolder for the demo/whitepaper.  PDF's will render in the browser when viewed on GitHub.

Lastly, link from this main ```README.md``` page to your new demo/whitepaper and the corresponding ```README.md``` or PDF file.
